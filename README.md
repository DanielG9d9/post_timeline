# price_timeline
A tool to upload your posts as a csv and save it as an interactive HTML website.

1. Download a CSV of the asset price you want to use. Anything other than Bitcoin will require you to update the names in the python script.
2. Input any posts in the "Post" column and links in the "Link" column.
3. Point the script to your file and run it.
4. Update HTML output with the javascript injection to enable clickable links.
